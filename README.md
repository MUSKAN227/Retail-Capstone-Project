## 🎯 Business Objectives
The analysis aims to answer key retail questions:
- What are the overall sales trends over time?  
- Which products and categories generate the highest revenue?  
- Who are the top customers by purchase value?  
- Which regions or stores perform best?  
- Are there seasonal or monthly sales patterns?  
- How can insights improve inventory and sales strategies?

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding
- Reviewed dataset structure: transactions, products, customers, and sales metrics  
- Identified KPIs: **Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, Category Performance**

### 2. ETL Process
- **Extract** → Imported raw retail data into Python & SQL  
- **Transform** →  
  - Handled missing values & duplicates  
  - Converted date columns to datetime format  
  - Standardized column names  
  - Created calculated fields (e.g., `Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price`)  
  - Extracted Month & Year from transaction dates  
  - Aggregated sales by category, region, and customer  
- **Load** →  
  - Stored cleaned data in SQL tables  
  - Loaded into Power BI for visualization with defined relationships  

### 3. Data Analysis
- **Python (EDA)** → Summary statistics, trend analysis, category/product comparison, customer behavior, region-wise distribution  
- **SQL Queries** → Monthly revenue, top products, highest-spending customers, region totals, category ranking  

### 4. Business Intelligence Dashboard
- KPI summary cards (Revenue, Orders, Avg. Order Value)  
- Monthly sales trend charts  
- Category & product performance visuals  
- Customer & regional breakdowns  
- Interactive filters for dynamic analysis
